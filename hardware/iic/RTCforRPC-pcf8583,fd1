DIM data% 8
i2c_address% = &50

REM To read from the device you first have to write a byte to say what address you want to read
data%?0=1:SYS "IIC_Control", (i2c_address%<<1), data%, 1:REM Set base address

REM Then we can read the data from the clock registers - 6 bytes
SYS "IIC_Control", (i2c_address%<<1) + 1, data%, 6:REM Read cs,s,m,h,day|year,month

PRINT"Year        : ";~((data%?5) >> 6)
PRINT"Month       : ";~(data%?5 AND 31)
PRINT"Day         : ";~(data%?4 AND 63)
PRINT"Hour        : ";~data%?3
PRINT"Minute      : ";~data%?2
PRINT"Second      : ";~data%?1
PRINT"Centisecond : ";~data%?0
