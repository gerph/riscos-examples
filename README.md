# RISC OS Examples

## Introduction

This repository is intended to offer some examples of the use of RISC OS
APIs. In some cases, those APIs may be simple enough. In other cases, they
may have some subtleties that are not clear in documentation. The idea
of this repository is to offer examples that others may refer to.

As such, many of the examples will be very simple, and have no useful
purpose on their own. The example programs are intended to be short
BBC BASIC examples which just demonstrate an interface, or collection
of interfaces.

## Organisation

The repository is organised by the type of operation, in a similar structure
to that of the PRMs, so that it's easier to find the type of API required.

## Contributions

Anyone should be able to contribute - either fork the repository and submit
a merge request, or include some code in an issue to request it be added.
All contributors agree to the license for this repository - it is here to
make it easier for others to find ways of using interfaces when it might not
be obvious.

## License

This repository has no license. Anyone can use what's in here as they wish,
directly, indirectly, with or without attribution.
