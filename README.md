# RISC OS Examples

## Introduction

This repository is intended to offer some examples of the use of RISC OS
APIs. In some cases, those APIs may be simple enough. In other cases, they
may have some subtleties that are not clear in documentation. The idea
of this repository is to offer examples that others may refer to.

## Organisation

The repository is organised by the type of operation, in a similar structure
to that of the PRMs, so that it's easier to find the type of API required.
